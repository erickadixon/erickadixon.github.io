<p>
Hello! My name is Ericka Dixon and I am currently in a dual role doing philanthropy and marketing work for a non-profit hosital. Along with this, I am studying to obtain my master's degree in journalism innovation at Syracuse University. My career has primarily been in healthcare and retail, with journalism sprinkled in here and there. Due to this, a lot of my work is not current, however, with the marketing portion of my job, I am able to dabble in some broadcast work which is what my goal is.
